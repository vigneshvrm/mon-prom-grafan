          ============================================
          WinRM is not accessible on {{ inventory_hostname }}:5985
          ============================================
          
          WinRM must be configured on the Windows host BEFORE Ansible can connect.
          
          Please run these commands on the Windows host (as Administrator in PowerShell):
          
          1. Enable WinRM:
             winrm quickconfig -force
          
          2. Configure Basic Authentication:
             winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
             winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
          
          3. Configure WinRM Client:
             winrm set winrm/config/client/auth @{Basic="true"}
             winrm set winrm/config/client @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
          
          4. Allow WinRM through Windows Firewall:
             netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM HTTP" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5985
          
          5. Restart WinRM service:
             Restart-Service WinRM
          
          6. Verify WinRM is listening:
             winrm enumerate winrm/config/Listener
          
          After running these commands, try the installation again.
          
          Note: If you're behind a firewall, ensure port 5985 is open between
          the Ansible controller and the Windows host ({{ inventory_hostname }}).
